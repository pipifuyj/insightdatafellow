The codes are simple and short. To test the codes, I randomly sampled different sizes (1K, 10K, 100K, 1000K, etc.) with replacement from the three given tweets, and generated multiple test datasets. The experiments showed that the simple codes can correctly run on these datasets. But, I am not quite sure what is the standard size for the definition "large-scale data".
